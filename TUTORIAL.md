## üåê **Swifter: Ultra-Light HTTP Server**

### 1. Introduction to Swifter
Swifter is a minimalist HTTP server written in Swift. It's designed to be fast, lightweight, and simple to use. This package is particularly useful for hosting local files, testing APIs during development, or even creating a simple server for a project.

### 2. Installing Swifter
1. Open your project in Swift Playgrounds or Xcode.
2. Add Swifter via **Swift Package Manager** (SPM) with the following URL:  
   `https://github.com/httpswift/swifter.git`
3. Import Swifter in your Swift file:  
   ```swift
   import Swifter

### 3. Starting a Simple HTTP Server

Here‚Äôs a basic example of starting an HTTP server, listening for requests, and responding with a simple HTML message:

```swift
import Swifter

// Create the server
let server = HttpServer()

// Define a simple GET route
server["/"] = { _ in
    return HttpResponse.ok(.html("<h1>Welcome to my Swifter server!</h1>"))
}

// Start the server on port 8080
do {
    try server.start(8080)
    print("Server is running at http://localhost:8080")
} catch {
    print("Error starting server: \(error)")
}
```

### 4. Adding Dynamic Routes

Swifter allows you to create dynamic routes with parameters. For example, a route that takes a parameter in the URL and returns it in the response:

```swift
server["/user/:username"] = { request in
    if let username = request.parameters["username"] {
        return HttpResponse.ok(.html("<h1>Welcome, \(username)!</h1>"))
    }
    return HttpResponse.notFound
}
```

### 5. Handling POST Requests

Swifter also allows handling POST requests. Here‚Äôs how to retrieve data sent via a POST request:

```swift
server["/submit"] = { request in
    guard let formData = try? request.readBody(as: String.self) else {
        return HttpResponse.badRequest
    }
    return HttpResponse.ok(.html("<h1>Form submitted with data: \(formData)</h1>"))
}
```

### 6. Conclusion on Swifter

Swifter is a powerful tool for quickly setting up HTTP servers. It can be used for local testing, APIs, or simple web applications. You can easily add routes, handle HTTP requests, and customize responses.

Here‚Äôs how to highlight Swift code:

```swift
import Highlightr

let highlighter = Highlightr()

let swiftCode = """
import Foundation

let message = "Hello, World!"
print(message)
"""

if let highlightedCode = highlighter?.highlight(swiftCode, as: "swift") {
    print("Highlighted code:\n\(highlightedCode)")
}
```

### 4. Using Themes

Highlightr allows you to apply different syntax highlighting themes. You can apply an integrated theme like ‚Äúgithub‚Äù or create your own.

```swift
highlighter?.setTheme(to: "github") // Apply the GitHub theme
```

### 5. Using Highlightr in a SwiftUI View

Integrating Highlightr in a SwiftUI view to display highlighted code:

```swift
import SwiftUI
import Highlightr

struct CodeView: View {
    let highlighter = Highlightr()
    let code = """
    let a = 10
    let b = 20
    let sum = a + b
    print(sum)
    """
    
    var body: some View {
        Text(highlighter?.highlight(code, as: "swift") ?? "")
            .font(.system(.body, design: .monospaced))
            .padding()
            .background(Color.black)
            .foregroundColor(Color.white)
    }
}

struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        CodeView()
    }
}
```

### 6. Conclusion on Highlightr

Highlightr is incredibly useful for apps displaying source code. You can easily integrate syntax highlighting and handle multiple programming languages.

    print("Modified HTML:\n\(document.html())")
}
```

### 5. Extracting Specific Elements

You can extract specific elements by their class or ID, which is useful for scraping data:

```swift
let htmlWithClasses = """
<html>
<body>
<div class="container">
  <p class="content">Text to extract.</p>
</div>
</body>
</html>
"""

if let document = try? SwiftSoup.parse(htmlWithClasses) {
    let content = try? document.select(".content").text()
    print("Extracted content: \(content ?? "No content")")
}
```
